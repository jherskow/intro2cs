Functions making use of recursive logic.

======== FUNCTIONS ===========

Linear recursion
=====================
print_to_n                     - Prints integers 1 up to n including.
print_reversed                 - Prints integers n down to 1 including.
has_divisor_smaller_than       - returns true if n has a divisor d : n>d>1.
is_prime                       - Is n prime? T/F.
list_divisors_leq              - List of natural divisors of n, less than or equal to x.
divisors                       - List of natural divisors of natural n.
factorial                      - Returns factorial of natural n.
exp_n_x                        - Returns the exponential sum of n and x.

Non - Linear recursion
=====================
play_hanoi                     - Plays Hanoi.
binary_permutations            - Makes a list of binary permutations of length n.
print_binary_sequences         - Prints it.
make_sequences                 - Makes a list of letter permutations of length n.
print_sequences                - Prints it.
no_repetition_sequences_list   - Makes a list of letter permutations, without repetition,  of length n.
