==============================
=        Description:        =
==============================
A Spell checking game, with a logically correct hint functionality
whose lack of efficacy is mostly the fault of the english
language.

=========Functions============

# letter_to_index
    Exactly what it says on the tin

# index_to_letter
    Exactly what it says on the tin

# filter_words_list
    Returns a the sub-list of words given list that are:
    The same length as pattern.
    Include no letters from wrong_guess_list.
    If word shares a letter with pattern,
    it must share all of that letter in the same spaces.

# choose_letter
    Returns the most frequent letter from a list of words,
    which is not in the pattern.

# update_word_pattern
    Takes a word, a hangman pattern, and a letter
    and adds those letters to the pattern ehre they exist in word.
    
# display
    a helping function to simplify the calls to display state

# init_game
    Initialises all game variables into a dictionary
    This allows for simple calls to the game loop subfunctions

# game_loop
    main loop of ongoing game

# hint
   sub-function to return hint

# guess
   sub-function to check guess

# endgame
    Displays game result and prompts for rematch

# run_single_game
    Runs the game, with any word from the given list

# main():
    Loads words, and runs game

==============================
=      Special Comments      =
==============================
In init_game, i use a dictionary in order to increase the readability of the
code, and reduce the length of the game functions and sub-functions.
mosst function calls are then passed the dictionary instead of 5 parameters.

I still feel as if this might be an unorthodox approach, i can imagine it
is likely to affect memory use and runtime.
