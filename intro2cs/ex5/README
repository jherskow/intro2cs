==============================
This program is a selection of functions made to provide
useful operations on data structures representing stores.

== The first few functions provide basic functionality:
get_attribute             - Lookup
string_item               - String Representation
string_store_items        - Batch string representation

== More complex funtionalities:
read_prices_file          - Create DB from a compatible XML file.
filter_store              - Batch filter and serch by text.

== "basket" objects enable the user to view and compare
== several items at once
create_basket_from_txt    - You guessed it.
get_basket_prices         - You guessed it again. returns a list.
sum_basket                - Provides the sum of such a list
basket_item_name          - performs a name lookup on an item code in a basket.
save_basket               - saves basket in format compatible with basket_from_text
load_basket               - Loads basket using basket_from_text

Finally, best_basket performs a complex analysis of the database, and recommends a
store to the user based on a combination of lowest prices and higest product availability.
