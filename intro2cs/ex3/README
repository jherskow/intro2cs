===Answers to ex3 questions===

1. Since 'abcd' and 'bcda' are both strings,
and not lists, the function should crash due to incorrect
parameter types.

2. Since n is given as 3 , a histogram will be created only
for values between 0 and n-1 (2) .
Return value should look like this:
[0,1,1]
for 0, 1 and 2 respectively.

3. Since range is unable to create a range(2,0) the result
will be the same as prime_factors(1):
The function will never enter the loop, and the rturn value
will be: []

4. The return value will be correct, i.e. all pars will sum to 2.
But since numbers appear more than once, so will pairs.
For example, [1,0] and [1,0], which are both unique valid pairs,
will each appear twice, instead of once each.
